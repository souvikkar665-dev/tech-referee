# ⚖️ Tech Referee

Tech Referee is a decision-support tool that helps developers
choose the right frontend hosting platform based on real-world constraints.

Instead of providing a single fixed answer, it compares trade-offs
between multiple options.

## 🔍 Platforms Compared
- Netlify
- Vercel
- AWS S3 + CloudFront

## 🧠 Decision Factors
- Budget
- Expected traffic
- Management complexity

## ⭐ Why AWS is marked as most scalable
AWS S3 + CloudFront is recommended only when:
- Traffic is high
- Advanced control is required

This ensures the tool explains **why** a solution fits,
instead of blindly recommending it.
